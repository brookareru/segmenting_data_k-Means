# segmenting_data_k-Means

The primary objective of clustering is to group items within a dataset based on similarity. k-Means Clustering is one of the most popular and easy to use clustering approaches. With k-Means Clustering, similarity is based on a distance metric known as euclidean distance. By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned:
